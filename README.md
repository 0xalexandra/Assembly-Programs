# Assembly-Programs
A university project, in which I developed three programs in Assembly Language for the MIPS32 processor.

## Objective
My objective with this project is to make three programs: The first one encrypts a 4 digit number given by the user, the second program does error detection in a message given by the user, using Hamming code, and the third gives us the biggest number in an array given by the user.

## How to run the programs
* Download the QtSpim simulator for MIPS32 Assembly language programs.
* In the QtSpim simulator, select "Reinitialize and Load File", under the "File" tab.
* Then select the program you would like to run and change the file type filter to "Text files (*.txt)".
* Afterwards, select "Run/Continue", under the "Simulator" tab. 

## Skills Learned
* Assembly programming language
* Encryption techniques
* Hamming code
